=== Data Collection

==== Problem

In order to create a report, we have to collect the data we want to report on.

==== Alternatives and Solution/Decision

The first version of the FilmStrip-Plugin crawled through the generated screenshots and tried to extract all data from the the image name and its path.

The current version uses a ReportListener to collect the data. The ReportListener gets some more information than the one available in the file system like the URL and name of page object.

Since there is only an +onReport+ event and no +onReportFinished+ and because of the data provided, the data collection is a two step process:

. extract the needed data from the +onReport+ event
. transform the result into a better structured map without redundancy

The data from step one is collected in a JSON formatted report file and read in step two from this file.

The number together with the label of the test and report is made available as one String, joined together with dashed ('-'). So if the labels contain a dash themself, the labels will not be extracted the right way. To solve this, the +geb.report.ReporterSupport+ got monkey patches through meta-programming.
