== Solution Strategy

The plugin uses the +ReportingListener+ provided by geb to collect the needed data.
Since geb can only provide an +onReport+-method, it is hard to collect the data
in memory. So the solution is to write the data from these report snapshots to a file
as JSON strings.

Later, when Grails notifies the plugin that all tests have been executed, the plugin
will read those report snapshots and remove redundant information by generating a
better structured map which is also stored as JSON in another report file (in case
someone else want to base some functionality on this data).

In the next step, the plugin takes the created data structure and feeds it as model
into an HTML-Report-Template. Currently, this "template" is implemented as
+xml.MarkupBuilder+ but it will be soon replaced by a jsp like template which can
be easily provided by the project the plugin is used in.
