== Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The quality and form does not matter. If you don't have
much time, just drop me a note (ralf.d.mueller at gmail.com) or
https://github.com/rdmueller/grails-filmStrip/issues[add an issue].

If you have more time and want to contribute to the code, just fork the project
and create a pull request when ever you contribution is ready.

The easiest way to work on the project is to fork both, this repository and the
film strip fork of the petclinic project. Place them on the same level and the
petclinic project will already be configured to reference the film strip plugin
locally - this avoids having to build the plugin whenever you modify it.

Currently, there are no automated tests. So you are also not required to create tests :-).
