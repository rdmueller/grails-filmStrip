== Architecture Constraints

Since this plugin should be available to a wide range of developers, the plugin
should be compatible with a wide range of Grails versions (min. 2.2.4). The currently
not released Grails 3.0 is out of scope but will be in scope as soon
as it is released.

Since the plugin should be based on stable and released libraries, 0.7 is the
targeted Version of Spock.

The plugin has to work on windows and *nix and it should work with all webdrivers
which take screenshots, but it will only be tested against phantomJs.

Since maps are easy to handle in groovy and grails, the generated data model should not
be a complex java object, but a simple map.

Whenever the map has to be serialized, JSON should be used a format with pretty print
turned on. THis ensures that a developer is able to analyze the raw data.
