== Open Issues

In order to work offline on this project, all open issues are exported to this
document whenever it is updated. 
But if you want to open a new issue, just add it to the github issues 
located at https://github.com/rdmueller/grails-filmStrip/issues . The ultimate
goal is to sync these offline issues with the github ones.
