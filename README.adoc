grails-filmStrip-plugin
=======================

Geb and Spock is a great combination if you need to create functional tests for your Grails application.

A not so well known feature is the http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/testing.html#reporting[++report++] feature: +
whenever you use the command ++report "some text"++, geb tries to create a screenshot and save the current DOM as HTML.

This plugin crawls through the generated screenshots and creates an HTML report which displays preview images as film strip
on the bottom of the page and the test result on the main part of the window. When you click on an image, it will be displayed
full size, if you click on the name of a report image, the corresponding HTML file will be displayed. Without the proper path
to referenced files, this view will look broken, but it is very usefull for debugging.

The aim of this plugin is not only to help a tester in developing Geb/Spock tests and see what went wrong, but also to create
a report for your customer. With all those screenshot you can easily get an graphical overview of the application and
see if all pages display correctly.

=== Setup / Usage

There is not much to do in order to use the plugin. Just configure it in your +BuildConfig.groovy+ as

    test ":film-strip:0.1.3"

and add the folowing line to your gebConfig.groovy:

    reportingListener = new grails.plugin.filmstrip.FilmStripReportingListener()

If your geb ++reportDir++ is the standard one, the report will be generated after running ++grails test-app++.
